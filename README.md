### R1.D2
Today there is a lot of theory on pythons and a little practice, tomorrow it would be nice to add new data to the layout in HQ-Builder.

### R1.D3
Busy day. could only do a little work. I hope there will be more tomorrow.

A bit, but satisfied.

### R1.D5
The easy day just a little theory. Work with string in Python.

### R1.D6
Today I got to tuples and lists in python. Different from JS and confusing. Plus refreshed memory on SQL.

### R1.D7

### R1.D8
Studied tuples and lists for python today. in general, the whole week was very unsuitable for the test. Hope the next one is better.
